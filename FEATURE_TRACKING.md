# ABSNFS Feature Implementation Tracking

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of features documented in the ABSNFS performance tuning guide that are not yet implemented in the codebase. Our goal is to align the actual implementation with the documented capabilities, focusing on performance optimization options, caching strategies, and monitoring capabilities.

Each feature will be implemented in a separate branch to maintain clean development history. All implementations should include appropriate tests to ensure functionality and maintain code quality.

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Create a separate branch for each feature
2. Implement the feature according to the documentation
3. Add appropriate tests for the new functionality
4. Make small, focused commits with clear messages
5. Keep individual file sizes manageable
6. Update this document as features are completed

## Testing Strategy

For each feature, we aim to include the following tests:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between components
3. **Benchmark Tests**: Measure performance impact
4. **Edge Case Tests**: Test boundary conditions and error handling

Test coverage should aim for >80% for new code, with special attention to error handling paths.
