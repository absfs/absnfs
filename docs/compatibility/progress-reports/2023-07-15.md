# Client Compatibility Testing Progress - Week of July 15, 2023

> **Historical Document**: This report is from the initial compatibility testing phase in 2023.
> For current status, see the [main progress page](../progress.md).
> **Update (Nov 2025)**: All identified issues have been resolved. Linux 5.15+ is now fully compatible.

## Summary
- 1 client in testing (Linux Kernel 5.15+)
- 2 issues identified
- 1 workaround documented

## Achievements
- Completed testing methodology documentation
- Set up GitHub project board for tracking
- Started Linux 5.15+ client testing
- Completed file operations and directory operations test suites
- Established performance benchmarking baseline

## Challenges
- Encountered occasional stale file handle errors with heavy deletion workloads
- Need to improve test environment for network interruption testing
- Limited hardware resources for concurrent client testing

## Adjustments to Plan
- Prioritizing completion of Linux client testing before starting macOS
- Added additional test cases for file deletion scenarios based on findings
- Extended timeline for network reliability testing to allow for better test setup

## Next Week's Focus
- Complete reliability testing for Linux client
- Finalize performance benchmarks for Linux
- Set up macOS test environment
- Begin documenting recommended configurations for Linux

## Resources Needed
- Additional storage for large file testing
- Access to network simulation tools for interruption testing
- Mac hardware or VM for next phase of testing
