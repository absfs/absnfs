# Client Compatibility Testing Progress - Week of July 25, 2023

## Summary
- 2 clients in testing (Linux Kernel 5.15+, macOS 15.4)
- 4 issues identified total
- 2 workarounds documented

## Achievements
- Started testing macOS 15.4 (Sequoia) client
- Verified basic file operations on macOS
- Completed initial performance benchmarking on macOS
- Identified workaround for macOS sleep/wake disconnection issue
- Continued testing of Linux 5.15 client
- Updated documentation framework with real test results

## Challenges
- macOS Finder "Operation not permitted" error with certain permission combinations
- Need to develop better methodology for sleep/wake cycle testing
- Intermittent issues with network simulation for interruption testing
- Need to coordinate testing across multiple development environments

## Adjustments to Plan
- Prioritized macOS testing to use local development environment effectively
- Added additional test cases for Finder-specific behavior
- Extended timeline for sleep/wake cycle testing to ensure thorough validation

## Next Week's Focus
- Complete reliability testing for macOS client
- Finalize Linux client testing
- Begin documenting recommended configurations for both platforms
- Create automated test script for basic mount operations

## Resources Needed
- Need to set up a Windows test environment
- Need network simulation tools for reliable interruption testing

## Detailed Progress
