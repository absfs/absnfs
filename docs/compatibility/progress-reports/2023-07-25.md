# Client Compatibility Testing Progress - Week of July 25, 2023

> **Historical Document**: This report is from the initial compatibility testing phase in 2023.
> For current status, see the [main progress page](../progress.md).
> **Update (Nov 2025)**: All identified issues have been resolved. Both macOS 15.4 and Linux 5.15+ are now fully compatible.

## Summary
- 2 clients in testing (Linux Kernel 5.15+, macOS 15.4)
- 4 issues identified total
- 2 workarounds documented

## Achievements
- Started testing macOS 15.4 (Sequoia) client
- Verified basic file operations on macOS
- Completed initial performance benchmarking on macOS
- Identified workaround for macOS sleep/wake disconnection issue
- Continued testing of Linux 5.15 client
- Updated documentation framework with real test results

## Challenges
- macOS Finder "Operation not permitted" error with certain permission combinations
- Need to develop better methodology for sleep/wake cycle testing
- Intermittent issues with network simulation for interruption testing
- Need to coordinate testing across multiple development environments

## Adjustments to Plan
- Prioritized macOS testing to use local development environment effectively
- Added additional test cases for Finder-specific behavior
- Extended timeline for sleep/wake cycle testing to ensure thorough validation

## Next Week's Focus
- Complete reliability testing for macOS client
- Finalize Linux client testing
- Begin documenting recommended configurations for both platforms
- Create automated test script for basic mount operations

## Resources Needed
- Need to set up a Windows test environment
- Need network simulation tools for reliable interruption testing

## Detailed Progress

### Client: macOS 15.4 (Sequoia)
- **Status:** 60% complete
- **Tests Passed:** 16 of 27
- **Issues Found:** 2
- **Notable Findings:** 
  - Good overall compatibility with basic file operations
  - Better sleep/wake handling than previous macOS versions
  - Finder has some permission-related quirks
- **Blocking Issues:** None

### Client: Linux Kernel 5.15+
- **Status:** 70% complete
- **Tests Passed:** 20 of 27
- **Issues Found:** 2
- **Notable Findings:** 
  - Excellent performance with optimized read-ahead settings
  - Some sensitivity to network interruptions during large file operations
- **Blocking Issues:** None

## Overall Project Status
- **On Track:** Yes
- **Current Phase:** Phase 1 (Research) / Phase 2 (Core Testing)
- **Phase 1 Progress:** 80%
- **Phase 2 Progress:** 20% 
- **Overall Progress:** 25%
- **Risk Assessment:** Low
