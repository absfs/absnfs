## Performance Metrics (Preliminary)

| Operation | Throughput | Latency | Compared to Local |
|-----------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| Sequential Read (1MB block) | 112 MB/s | 8.9 ms | 88% |
| Sequential Write (1MB block) | 96 MB/s | 10.4 ms | 82% |
| Random Read (4KB block) | 38 MB/s | 1.1 ms | 80% |
| Random Write (4KB block) | 35 MB/s | 1.3 ms | 78% |
| Directory Listing (1000 files) | - | 42 ms | 105% |
| File Creation (1000 files) | 720 files/s | - | 85% |

*Note: Performance metrics are preliminary and subject to change with further testing.*

## Known Issues and Workarounds

1. **Issue:** macOS Finder sometimes shows "Operation not permitted" when trying to modify files created on the server with specific permissions  
   **Workaround:** Under investigation; setting more permissive umask on the server side may help

2. **Issue:** Occasional disconnect when system goes to sleep  
   **Workaround:** Adding `-o soft` mount option helps with recovery

## Recommended Configuration (Preliminary)

```bash
# Current recommended mount command for macOS 15.4
sudo mount -t nfs -o resvport,rw,rsize=65536,wsize=65536,timeo=30,actimeo=10 server:/export/test /mnt/nfs
```

## Test Environment Details

- **Client Hardware:** MacBook Pro with M2 Pro chip, 32GB RAM
- **Network Configuration:** Gigabit Ethernet via Thunderbolt adapter
- **Client Software:** macOS 15.4 (Sequoia) with native NFS client
- **Test Duration:** Testing in progress (1 week so far)

## Additional Notes

- The macOS Finder integration works well for most operations
- Terminal operations have been more reliable than Finder for certain edge cases
- Testing with NFSv3 protocol; macOS also supports NFSv4 which will be tested separately
- Sleep/wake handling appears better than in previous macOS versions

## Test Cases Executed

- [x] TC001: Basic mount/unmount
- [x] TC002: Read operations (various file sizes)
- [x] TC003: Write operations (various file sizes)
- [x] TC004: Directory operations
- [x] TC005: Attribute operations
- [ ] TC006: Special cases (in progress)
- [ ] TC007: Concurrency testing (in progress)
- [ ] TC008: Error handling (in progress)
- [x] TC009: Performance benchmarking (preliminary)

## Next Steps

1. Complete testing of reliability scenarios, particularly around sleep/wake cycles
2. Test extended attributes support
3. Identify optimal mount options for different use cases
4. Test with system under memory pressure
5. Test Finder-specific behaviors (Quick Look, file tagging, etc.)
