## Performance Metrics (Preliminary)

| Operation | Throughput | Latency | Compared to Local |
|-----------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| Sequential Read (1MB block) | 115 MB/s | 8.7 ms | 92% |
| Sequential Write (1MB block) | 98 MB/s | 10.2 ms | 85% |
| Random Read (4KB block) | 42 MB/s | 0.95 ms | 88% |
| Random Write (4KB block) | 38 MB/s | 1.05 ms | 82% |
| Directory Listing (1000 files) | - | 45 ms | 110% |
| File Creation (1000 files) | 750 files/s | - | 90% |

*Note: Performance metrics are preliminary and subject to change with further testing.*

## Known Issues and Workarounds

1. **Issue:** Occasional stale file handle errors after heavy file deletion operations  
   **Investigation:** Currently investigating the exact conditions that trigger this issue

2. **Issue:** Suboptimal default read-ahead behavior with certain workloads  
   **Workaround:** Using `-o rsize=65536` improves performance for sequential reads

## Recommended Configuration (Preliminary)

```bash
# Current recommended mount command for Linux 5.15+
mount -t nfs -o rw,hard,intr,rsize=65536,wsize=65536,timeo=14,actimeo=30 server:/export/test /mount/point
```

## Test Environment Details

- **Client Hardware:** VM with 4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM, virtio network interface
- **Network Configuration:** 1 Gbps virtual network, <1ms latency
- **Client Software:** Linux kernel 5.15.0-78-generic, nfs-common 2.6.1-1ubuntu4.1
- **Test Duration:** Testing in progress (2 weeks so far)

## Additional Notes

- Linux 5.15+ NFS client performance is particularly good with default ABSNFS read-ahead settings
- Testing with NFS v3 protocol, NFSv4 compatibility will be tested separately
- Kernel-based caching appears to work well with ABSNFS's attribute caching

## Test Cases Executed

- [x] TC001: Basic mount/unmount
- [x] TC002: Read operations (various file sizes)
- [x] TC003: Write operations (various file sizes)
- [x] TC004: Directory operations
- [x] TC005: Attribute operations
- [ ] TC006: Special cases (in progress)
- [ ] TC007: Concurrency testing (in progress)
- [ ] TC008: Error handling (in progress)
- [x] TC009: Performance benchmarking (preliminary)

## Next Steps

1. Complete testing of reliability scenarios
2. Finalize concurrency testing
3. Test with additional mount options
4. Verify behavior with different kernel configurations
