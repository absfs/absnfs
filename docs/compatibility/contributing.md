# Contributing to NFS Client Compatibility Testing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the ABSNFS client compatibility testing efforts! Your contributions will help create a comprehensive compatibility guide that benefits the entire ABSNFS community.

## Ways to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to our compatibility testing efforts:

1. **Test a new client**: Test ABSNFS with a client that hasn't been tested yet
2. **Verify existing reports**: Confirm or provide additional information for existing client reports
3. **Report issues**: Report compatibility issues you've encountered with specific clients
4. **Document workarounds**: Share workarounds for known issues
5. **Improve test methodology**: Suggest improvements to our testing approach
6. **Develop test tools**: Create tools to automate testing or improve reporting

## Getting Started

### 1. Check Current Status

Before starting, check the [compatibility matrix](./index.md) and [progress tracking](./progress.md) to see which clients have already been tested or are in progress.

### 2. Set Up Test Environment

Set up a test environment following our [testing methodology](./testing/methodology.md):

- Install the client OS or environment you want to test
- Install the latest version of ABSNFS
- Configure the test environment according to guidelines
- Ensure you can collect relevant logs and performance data

### 3. Run the Tests

Execute the standard test suite:

- Follow the test procedure in our [methodology document](./testing/methodology.md)
- Document your results using our [client report template](./testing/templates.md)
- Be thorough and test all aspects of compatibility
- Take screenshots or logs when encountering issues

### 4. Document Your Findings

Create a detailed client compatibility report:

- Use the [client report template](./testing/templates.md)
- Include all relevant details about the client and test environment
- Document both successful operations and issues encountered
- Include workarounds for any issues you discovered
- Be specific about mount options and configurations tested

## Submission Process

### For GitHub Users

1. Fork the ABSNFS repository
2. Create a branch for your compatibility report
3. Add your client report to the `docs/compatibility/clients/` directory
4. Update the compatibility matrix in `docs/compatibility/index.md`
5. Submit a pull request with your changes
6. Respond to any feedback or questions during the review process

### For Non-GitHub Users

If you're not familiar with GitHub, you can still contribute:

1. Download the [client report template](./testing/templates.md)
2. Complete the template with your findings
3. Email your report to [project maintainers]
4. We'll review your submission and incorporate it into the documentation

## Quality Guidelines

To ensure high-quality compatibility documentation, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Be thorough**: Test all relevant functionality and options
2. **Be specific**: Include exact versions, configurations, and steps to reproduce issues
3. **Be objective**: Report actual behavior, not interpretations
4. **Provide context**: Include information about your test environment and configuration
5. **Document workarounds**: If you find issues, try to discover and document workarounds
6. **Include evidence**: Attach logs, screenshots, or other evidence when reporting issues

## Prioritized Clients

We're particularly interested in compatibility reports for the following clients:

1. Linux distributions with different kernel versions
2. macOS versions 11+
3. Windows 10 and 11
4. FreeBSD and other BSD variants
5. Virtualization platforms (VMware, VirtualBox, etc.)
6. Container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, Docker, etc.)
7. Mobile/embedded NFS clients
8. Enterprise storage systems with NFS client capabilities

## Recognition

All contributors to our compatibility testing efforts will be acknowledged in:

1. The client compatibility report
2. Our contributors page
3. Release notes when the compatibility guide is updated

## Questions and Support

If you have questions about contributing to compatibility testing, please:

1. Review our [testing methodology](./testing/methodology.md) and [templates](./testing/templates.md)
2. Check existing [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/absfs/absnfs/issues)
3. Join our [community discussion forum]
4. Contact the maintainers directly at [email]
