# Setup Instructions for Client Compatibility Tracking

This document provides instructions for setting up the GitHub-specific components of the client compatibility tracking system.

## 1. GitHub Project Board Setup

To set up the GitHub project board for client compatibility testing:

1. Go to your GitHub repository (https://github.com/absfs/absnfs)
2. Navigate to the "Projects" tab
3. Click "New project"
4. Select "Board" as the template
5. Name the project "NFS Client Compatibility Testing"
6. Create the project
7. Add the following columns:
   - üìã Backlog
   - üîç Researching
   - üß™ Testing
   - üìù Documenting
   - ‚úÖ Complete
8. Configure automation rules:
   - Set issues labeled with "client-research" to move to "Researching"
   - Set issues labeled with "client-testing" to move to "Testing"
   - Set issues labeled with "client-documentation" to move to "Documenting"
   - Set issues labeled with "client-complete" to move to "Complete"

## 2. GitHub Labels Setup

Create the following labels in your repository:

1. `compatibility` - Color: `#0075ca` - For all compatibility-related issues
2. `client-research` - Color: `#fbca04` - For clients in research phase
3. `client-testing` - Color: `#d93f0b` - For clients in active testing
4. `client-documentation` - Color: `#0e8a16` - For clients in documentation phase
5. `client-complete` - Color: `#8256d0` - For completed client testing

To create these labels:
1. Go to your repository
2. Navigate to "Issues" tab
3. Click "Labels"
4. Click "New label" and create each label with the specified name and color

## 3. GitHub Actions Setup

The GitHub Actions workflows for compatibility documentation validation have already been created in:
- `.github/workflows/validate-compatibility-docs.yml`

This workflow will:
1. Validate client report formats
2. Update the compatibility matrix automatically
3. Check consistency between progress tracking and client reports

No additional setup is needed as the workflow will run automatically on changes to the `docs/compatibility/` directory.

## 4. Create Initial Client Issues

For each client in the testing queue, create an issue using the template:

1. Go to "Issues" tab
2. Click "New issue"
3. Select "Client Compatibility Testing" template
4. Fill in the client details
5. Submit the issue

The issues will automatically be added to the project board in the "Researching" column.

## 5. Link Documentation to Issues

When working on client documentation:

1. Include the issue number in commit messages (e.g., "Add Linux 5.15 client report #123")
2. Add a note at the bottom of client reports linking to the corresponding issue
3. Update the issue checklist as testing progresses

## 6. Weekly Progress Reports

Set up a recurring task to create weekly progress reports:

1. Create a new file in `docs/compatibility/progress-reports/` each week
2. Use the template in `docs/compatibility/testing/progress-report-template.md`
3. Update the main progress tracking page with a link to the latest report

## 7. Monitoring Dashboard (Optional)

For a more visual dashboard:

1. Consider setting up GitHub Pages for the documentation site
2. Create a simple dashboard page with embedded project board views
3. Add charts showing progress over time

## 8. Automating Compatibility Matrix Updates

The GitHub Action script will automatically update the compatibility matrix based on client reports, but you can also run it manually:

```bash
python .github/scripts/update_compatibility_matrix.py
```

## 9. Initial Project Population

Once the project board is set up:

1. Create an issue for each client identified in the testing queue
2. Add them to the project board
3. Prioritize the backlog based on your testing plan
4. Assign initial issues to team members

## 10. Regular Review Schedule

Establish a regular review schedule:

1. Weekly review of active testing
2. Bi-weekly review of overall project progress
3. Monthly planning for upcoming client testing

Document these meetings and their outcomes in the progress reports.

With these components set up, you'll have a comprehensive system for tracking client compatibility testing progress that combines GitHub's project management features with detailed documentation.
