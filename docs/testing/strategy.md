# Test Strategy

This page outlines the overall testing strategy for ABSNFS, detailing how testing is approached to ensure reliability and correctness.

## Testing Philosophy

ABSNFS follows these key testing principles:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all public APIs and critical internal components
2. **Real-World Scenarios**: Test cases reflect actual usage patterns
3. **Error Path Testing**: Explicitly test error conditions and edge cases
4. **Performance Considerations**: Include tests for performance characteristics
5. **Integration Focus**: Ensure components work together correctly

## Test Types

The testing strategy incorporates multiple types of tests:

### Unit Tests

Unit tests verify individual functions and methods in isolation. They typically:
- Test a single function or method
- Mock or stub dependencies
- Verify correct behavior in normal and error cases
- Run quickly and reliably

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly. They:
- Test multiple components interacting
- Use real implementations rather than mocks
- Verify end-to-end behavior
- Cover complex interactions between components

### Table-Driven Tests

Table-driven tests systematically test multiple input/output combinations. They:
- Define a table of test cases with inputs and expected outputs
- Run the same test logic across all cases
- Provide clear error messages identifying which case failed
- Make it easy to add new test cases

### Property-Based Tests

Property-based tests verify that certain properties always hold, using randomized inputs. They:
- Generate random valid inputs
- Verify that properties hold for all generated inputs
- Help discover edge cases that manual testing might miss

### Benchmark Tests

Benchmark tests measure performance characteristics. They:
- Measure execution time of critical operations
- Compare performance between implementations
- Ensure performance remains consistent over time
- Identify performance regressions

## Test Infrastructure

ABSNFS testing uses Go's standard testing framework with some enhancements:

1. **Helper utilities**: Common test setup and teardown code
2. **Fixtures**: Standardized test data sets
3. **Custom assertions**: Domain-specific test assertions
4. **Test timeouts**: Prevents tests from hanging indefinitely

## Test Organization

Tests are organized alongside the code they test:

1. Each package has corresponding `*_test.go` files
2. Tests for a specific file are in a corresponding test file (e.g., `server.go` â†’ `server_test.go`)
3. Test helpers and fixtures are in separate test files
4. Benchmarks are in dedicated `*_bench_test.go` files

## Testing Process

The testing process includes these key aspects:

### Continuous Testing

Tests are run:
- Locally before committing changes
- In CI for all pull requests
- Nightly against the main branch

### Test Environments

Tests run in multiple environments:
- Go's latest stable version
- The minimum supported Go version
- Multiple operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows)

### Coverage Analysis

Code coverage is analyzed to:
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage
- Identify untested code paths
- Track coverage trends over time

### Regression Testing

Regression testing ensures that:
- Fixed bugs don't reappear
- New features don't break existing functionality
- Performance doesn't degrade

## Special Testing Areas

Some areas receive special testing attention:

### Protocol Correctness

NFS protocol operations are tested for conformance to the protocol specification, including:
- XDR encoding/decoding
- Error code mapping
- Protocol state management

### Concurrency

Concurrent operations are tested to ensure:
- Thread safety
- Correct synchronization
- Absence of deadlocks and race conditions

### Resource Management

Resource management is tested to ensure:
- Resources are properly allocated and released
- Memory leaks don't occur
- High resource usage is handled gracefully

## Test Quality Assurance

The quality of tests themselves is assured through:

1. **Code reviews**: Tests are reviewed like production code
2. **Test refactoring**: Tests are maintained and improved over time
3. **Failure analysis**: Test failures are thoroughly investigated
4. **Test coverage**: Meta-testing ensures tests cover important paths

## Future Improvements

The testing strategy will evolve with these planned improvements:

1. **Fuzzing**: Adding fuzz testing for protocol parsing
2. **Simulation testing**: Testing under simulated failure conditions
3. **Load testing**: Testing behavior under high load
4. **Compatibility testing**: Testing with diverse NFS clients

## Test Reliability

To ensure test reliability:

1. **Deterministic tests**: Tests produce consistent results
2. **Isolated tests**: Tests don't interfere with each other
3. **Clean environment**: Tests start with a clean environment
4. **Explicit timeouts**: Tests don't hang indefinitely

## Conclusion

The ABSNFS testing strategy aims to build confidence in the library's correctness, performance, and reliability. By combining different test types and focusing on real-world usage patterns, the tests help ensure that ABSNFS works correctly in production environments.

While no testing strategy can guarantee the absence of all bugs, the comprehensive approach taken by ABSNFS significantly reduces the risk of issues in production use.
