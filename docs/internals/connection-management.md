# Connection Management

This document describes the implementation of connection management features in the ABSNFS server.

## Overview

To improve network resource utilization and protect against resource exhaustion, we've added connection management capabilities to the ABSNFS server. These features allow administrators to limit the number of concurrent connections and automatically close idle connections after a configurable period.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Connection Limiting

- **Option**: `MaxConnections int` in ExportOptions
- **Default**: `100`
- **Purpose**: Limits the maximum number of concurrent client connections to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Implementation**: When a client connects, the server checks if the connection count is below the limit before accepting it

### 2. Idle Connection Timeout

- **Option**: `IdleTimeout time.Duration` in ExportOptions
- **Default**: `5 * time.Minute`
- **Purpose**: Automatically closes connections that have been inactive for the specified duration
- **Implementation**: Activity time is tracked for each connection and a background goroutine periodically checks for and closes idle connections

## Implementation Details

1. **Connection Tracking**:
   - Added a connection tracking map in the Server struct to keep track of active connections and their last activity time
   - Added mutex protection for thread-safe access to the connection information
   - Implemented connection registration, activity tracking, and unregistration

2. **Connection Limiting**:
   - Modified the acceptLoop function to check the connection count against the limit before accepting new connections
   - When the limit is reached, new connections are immediately closed
   - Debug logging provides visibility into connection rejection events

3. **Idle Connection Management**:
   - Added a background goroutine that periodically checks for idle connections
   - The check interval is dynamically calculated based on the idle timeout
   - Connections that have been inactive longer than the IdleTimeout are automatically closed

4. **Server Shutdown Enhancement**:
   - Modified the Stop() method to close all active connections during shutdown
   - Ensures clean resource reclamation during server restarts or shutdown

## Usage Example

```go
fs, _ := memfs.NewFS()
nfs, _ := New(fs, ExportOptions{
    // Limit to 200 concurrent connections
    MaxConnections: 200,
    
    // Close connections after 10 minutes of inactivity
    IdleTimeout: 10 * time.Minute,
})
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Connection Limiting**: Helps prevent resource exhaustion under high client loads, ensuring the server remains responsive to existing clients
- **Idle Connection Timeout**: Recovers resources from abandoned connections, particularly important in environments where clients may disconnect unexpectedly
- **Activity Tracking**: Minimal overhead as it only updates timestamps during RPC transactions

## Testing

The implementation includes tests to verify:
- Default values are applied correctly
- Custom values are preserved
- Connection tracking works as expected with limits enforced
- Idle connection cleanup properly identifies and closes inactive connections
- Connection cleanup during server shutdown

## Future Enhancements

Future improvements in this area could include:
- Per-client connection limits or quotas
- Connection prioritization based on client source
- More sophisticated activity tracking for better idle detection
- Gradual connection limiting under resource pressure
