# Operation Batching

This document describes the implementation of the Operation Batching feature for the ABSNFS project.

## Overview

The Operation Batching feature enhances the NFS server's performance by grouping similar operations together for concurrent processing. Instead of processing each operation individually, operations of the same type (reads, writes, attribute lookups) targeting the same file handle are batched together, reducing overhead and improving throughput when many similar operations are performed simultaneously.

## Key Components

1. **Configuration Options**:
   - `BatchOperations bool`: Enables/disables operation batching
   - `MaxBatchSize int`: Maximum number of operations in a single batch
   - Default values: true, 10

2. **BatchProcessor Type**:
   - Manages batching of similar operations by type
   - Implements a configurable delay for optimal batch size
   - Processes batches concurrently using worker pool
   - Handles request/response routing for batched operations

3. **Batch and BatchRequest Types**:
   - Represent a group of similar operations and individual operations
   - Track operation metadata for processing and metrics
   - Provide structured result handling for batched operations

4. **Operation Categories**:
   - Read operations (sequential or random file reads)
   - Write operations (file modifications)
   - GetAttr operations (file attribute queries)
   - SetAttr operations (file attribute modifications)
   - Directory read operations (directory listings)

5. **Integration with AbsfsNFS**:
   - Added `batchProc` field to AbsfsNFS struct
   - Modified Read and Write methods to use batch processing
   - Added proper initialization and cleanup in New() and Close()

## Implementation Details

1. **Batch Categorization**:
   ```go
   // BatchType identifies the type of operations in a batch
   type BatchType int
   
   const (
       BatchTypeRead BatchType = iota
       BatchTypeWrite
       BatchTypeGetAttr
       BatchTypeSetAttr
       BatchTypeDirRead
   )
   ```

2. **Batch Processing Logic**:
   - Operations of the same type are collected until either:
     - The batch reaches MaxBatchSize
     - A configurable timeout expires (currently 10ms)
   - Batches are processed asynchronously using the worker pool
   - Results are returned through result channels to the waiting callers

3. **File Handle Optimization**:
   - Operations on the same file handle are grouped together
   - Sequential reads/writes on the same file can be optimized
   - Shared file open/close operations reduce syscall overhead

4. **Integration with Existing Code**:
   - Read and Write operations check for file handles first
   - If a handle is found, operations are routed through the batch processor
   - Results are delivered through the same interfaces as direct operations
   - Fallback to direct processing if batching is disabled or fails

## Performance Benefits

1. **Reduced Syscall Overhead**: Fewer file open/close operations
2. **Better I/O Patterns**: Grouped operations can be optimized for sequential access
3. **Improved Concurrency**: Operations can be processed in parallel by type
4. **Reduced Lock Contention**: Fewer locks needed for grouped operations
5. **Lower CPU Usage**: Less context switching between operations

## Testing Strategy

The implementation includes comprehensive testing:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - `TestBatchProcessor`: Tests core batch processing functionality
   - `TestBatchOptions`: Verifies configuration options behave correctly

2. **Operation Tests**:
   - Batch read operations with varying sizes and offsets
   - Batch write operations with different data
   - Attribute operations batching

3. **Integration Tests**:
   - `TestIntegrationWithReadWrite`: Tests integration with existing Read/Write methods
   - Ensures compatibility with other NFS server features

4. **Concurrency Tests**:
   - Tests multiple concurrent batch requests
   - Verifies correct result routing in concurrent scenarios

## Usage Example

```go
// Enable operation batching with custom settings
options := ExportOptions{
    BatchOperations: true,
    MaxBatchSize:    20,
}

// Create NFS server with operation batching
server, err := absnfs.New(fs, options)

// Operations will automatically use batching when beneficial
```

## Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:

1. Dynamic batch sizing based on operation patterns
2. Smart batching based on file access patterns (sequential vs. random)
3. Priority-based batch scheduling for latency-sensitive operations
4. Enhanced metrics to track batch efficiency and optimizations
5. Integration with memory pressure detection for adaptive batch sizing
