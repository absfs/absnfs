# Component Interactions

This document describes how the various components of the ABSNFS server interact with each other to process NFS requests and manage resources.

## Core Components

The ABSNFS server consists of several key components:

1. **RPC Server**: Handles the underlying RPC protocol communication
2. **NFS Handler**: Implements the NFS protocol operations
3. **File Handle Manager**: Maps between NFS file handles and filesystem paths
4. **Attribute Cache**: Caches file attributes for improved performance
5. **Export Manager**: Manages exported filesystem paths and their options
6. **Worker Pool**: Distributes client requests across multiple worker goroutines
7. **Batch Processor**: Groups similar operations together for concurrent processing
8. **Connection Manager**: Tracks and manages client connections
9. **Metrics Collector**: Gathers performance and health metrics

## Interaction Workflow

### Request Processing Flow

1. **Client Connection**:
   - TCP connection is accepted by the RPC Server
   - Connection Manager tracks the new connection
   - TCP options are applied (buffer sizes, keepalive, etc.)

2. **RPC Message Handling**:
   - RPC messages are decoded by the RPC Server
   - Messages are categorized (MOUNT or NFS protocol)
   - Appropriate handler is selected based on program ID

3. **NFS Operation Processing**:
   - NFS Handler receives the decoded operation request
   - Worker Pool assigns the operation to an available worker
   - File handles are translated to filesystem paths
   - Attribute Cache is checked for cached attributes

4. **Operation Execution**:
   - Similar operations may be grouped by the Batch Processor
   - The operation is executed on the underlying filesystem
   - Results are encoded into the appropriate NFS protocol format
   - Metrics are collected about the operation

5. **Response Delivery**:
   - The response is encoded as an RPC message
   - The message is sent back to the client
   - Connection activity timestamp is updated

## Key Interactions

### Worker Pool and Batch Processor

The Worker Pool and Batch Processor work together to optimize throughput:

1. Worker Pool receives operations from the NFS Handler
2. Similar operations are identified and grouped by the Batch Processor
3. Batched operations are assigned to workers for execution
4. Results are unbatched and returned to the correct calling contexts

### Connection Manager and TCP Options

The Connection Manager works with TCP Options to optimize network performance:

1. New connections are configured with appropriate TCP buffer sizes and options
2. Connection Manager tracks connection activity and counts
3. Idle connections are identified and closed after the configured timeout
4. Connection limits are enforced to prevent resource exhaustion

### Attribute Cache and Memory Monitor

The Attribute Cache and Memory Monitor coordinate resource usage:

1. Attribute Cache maintains cached file attributes for improved performance
2. Memory Monitor tracks system memory usage
3. When memory pressure is detected, the Attribute Cache reduces its size
4. Eviction policies prioritize keeping frequently accessed attributes

## Performance Considerations

The interactions between components are designed to minimize overhead:

1. **Lock Contention**: Components use lock-free algorithms where possible
2. **Data Sharing**: Shared data structures are designed for concurrent access
3. **Locality**: Related operations are processed together to improve cache efficiency
4. **Resource Management**: Components coordinate resource usage to prevent exhaustion

## Conclusion

The ABSNFS server's component interactions are designed to provide high performance, scalability, and reliability. By distributing work across multiple specialized components and coordinating their activities, the server can efficiently handle high volumes of NFS requests while making optimal use of system resources.
